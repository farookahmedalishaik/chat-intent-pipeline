## Project Overview

### What does the project do?

This project implements a complete, end-to-end Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)/ AI Data Analyst pipeline for **Intent Classification**. It automatically processes text messages, fine-tunes a powerful **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** model to understand and categorize the underlying intent of these messages, and then deploys this model as an interactive web application for real-time predictions. The pipeline handles everything from data ingestion and cleaning, through secure storage in a **MySQL** database, to model training, evaluation, versioning on **Hugging Face Hub**, and public deployment on **Streamlit Cloud**.

### What does the project showcase?

* Demonstrates strong data handling, cleaning, feature engineering (through tokenization), and the ability to interpret model outputs (metrics, confusion matrices). It highlights understanding of how AI models consume and process data for business insights.

* Exhibits proficiency in data pipeline construction, SQL database management, data transformation, and presenting analytical insights (via Streamlit dashboards).

* Showcases expertise in deep learning model fine-tuning (BERT), MLOps principles (end-to-end pipeline, model versioning, deployment), efficient resource management (artifacts, checkpoints), and integration of various ML tools (Hugging Face, Streamlit, MySQL).

* Directly applies state of the art NLP techniques for text classification using transformer models.


### Summary

**This project builds a robust MLOps pipeline to automatically classify text message intents using a fine-tuned BERT model, making real-time predictions accessible via a deployed Streamlit web application.** It's a comprehensive demonstration of deep learning, data engineering, and seamless deployment in action.



## üåü Key Features

This project isn't just about building a model; it's about building a robust, repeatable, and insightful AI-driven data solution. Here's what makes this pipeline stand out:

* **Intelligent Intent Classification with BERT:** At its core, this pipeline employs a fine-tuned BERT-base-uncased model, a state-of-the-art transformer architecture, to accurately understand and categorize the underlying intent of diverse text messages.Enabling sophisticated understanding of nuanced customer queries.

    * Demonstrates deep learning model application, understanding of complex NLP embeddings, and the ability to leverage pre-trained large language models for specific business problems.


* **Automated Data Pipeline & Management:** From raw csv inputs, the system performs automated data ingestion, cleaning, and structured storage in a MySQL database. This ensures data quality and accessibility for downstream tasks.

    * Highlights strong ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) capabilities, SQL proficiency, and the establishment of a reliable data source for analytical insights and model training.


* **Comprehensive Data Preparation for ML:** The pipeline intelligently splits the dataset into stratified training, validation, and test sets, ensuring balanced representation of all intent classes. It also handles label encoding and BERT-specific tokenization, transforming raw text into model-ready tensors.

    * Showcases meticulous attention to data quality for model performance, understanding of data leakage prevention, and expertise in preparing complex unstructured data for deep learning.


* **Rigorous Model Evaluation & Insights:** Beyond just accuracy, the project includes automated calculation and visualization of critical model metrics on an unseen test set, including precision, recall, F1-score, and a detailed confusion matrix. These results are pushed directly to Hugging Face Hub for transparency.

    * Emphasizes strong analytical skills in model performance interpretation, identifying areas for model improvement, and understanding classification biases through visual tools like the confusion matrix.


* **Reproducible MLOps Workflow:** The entire process, from data processing to model deployment, is encapsulated in modular Python scripts, enabling reproducible experimentation and seamless updates. Model weights, tokenizer, and evaluation reports are systematically versioned on Hugging Face Hub.

    * Demonstrates practical application of MLOps principles, emphasis on reusability, version control for artifacts, and establishing a single source of truth for model assets.


* **Interactive Real-Time Prediction Dashboard:** A user-friendly web application, built with Streamlit and deployed on Streamlit Cloud, allows anyone to input a message and instantly receive the predicted intent. This dashboard also visually presents the model's test-set metrics and confusion matrix.

    * Highlights ability to productize ML models, build intuitive user interfaces, and effectively communicate complex AI insights to non-technical stakeholders.

# üìä Model Performance

## Intent Classification Model Training
The `finetune_bert.py` script orchestrates the training process, leveraging the Hugging Face Transformers library.

* Training Data: Preprocessed and tokenizded from the central MYSQL database
* Training Epochs: 6 (configurable in config.py)
* Batch Sizes: Train: 16, Evaluation: 32
* Framework: PyTorch with Hugging Face Trainer API

### Results (from Validation Set during training):
The model was evaluated on a held-out validation set after each epoch. The final performance metrics, based on the best model, are:

* Validation Loss: Approximately 0.0078
* Validation Accuracy: Approximately 99.88%

Note: These values might vary with each training run.



## Test Set Metrics

The fine-tuned BERT model's performance on the unseen test set is summarized below.A full interactive confusion matrix is available in the live Streamlit dashboard.

* Accuracy = 0.925
* Precision =0.920
* Recall = 0.930
* F1-Score = 0.925


# üóÑÔ∏è Data Sources & Management
The intent classification model was trained and evaluated using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, which was then merged with custom-generated synthetic data. This synthetic data includes a mix of standard English, common typographical errors, and slang to enhance the model's robustness.

## Primary Dataset:
* Source: The core dataset for intent classification was acquired from **Kaggle**.
* Description: This dataset comprises customer interaction messages, each annotated with a specific intent label. It serves as the foundation for training the BERT model to understand and categorize diverse user queries.
* Kaggle Link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohamedchahed/customer-intent-classfication
* Local Storage: The raw dataset is stored within this repository at `data/raw_customer_interactions.csv`.




## Data Ingestion & Cleaning:
The `ingest_clean.py` script loads raw data, performs masking and clenaing using preprocess.py and saves a cleaned version to (`data/cleaned_all.csv`).

This cleaned data is then loaded into a **MySQL database** via `load_to_mysql.py` for structured storage and efficient retrieval. This database (`intent_db` with table `messages`) acts as the central data repository for the pipeline.
